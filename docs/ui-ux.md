# UI & UX Notes

The interface focuses on clarity for administrators managing multiple members
and locations. Key improvements include:

## Navigation

- Tabbed layout maps directly to core workflows (Members, Locations, Shifts,
  Attendance, Salary).
- Role-aware navigation hides management tabs for non-admin users.

## Forms & Validation

- Inline validation communicates issues before submission (email format,
  required fields, numeric ranges).
- Disabled states with progress indicators prevent double submissions.
- File inputs for location logos enforce type/size limits and show preview
  metadata.

## Feedback & States

- Loading spinners and skeleton states provide instant feedback during network
  calls.
- Empty states explain how to populate data (e.g. “No shifts registered for this
  month yet”).
- Toast-style success/error messages summarise outcomes of bulk actions.

## Accessibility & Styling

- Keyboard focus is visible on all interactive elements.
- Buttons and links maintain sufficient contrast against the background.
- Responsive layout rules ensure data tables and cards remain readable on narrow
  viewports.

## Reporting Views

- Shift history surfaces location logos, travel allowances, and monthly totals
  for quick scanning.
- Payroll views group entries by location and include aggregated time/cost
  summaries alongside CSV export options.
